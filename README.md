## Part 1: Quiz (50 points, 5 points each)

Answer each question in your own words or with the exact output, as asked. Write your answer on the line under each question.

**1.** A dictionary stores data as key-value pairs. Write one line of Python that creates a dictionary named `student` with the keys `"name"` and `"major"` and values of your choosing.

Your answer: student = {"name": "Althea", "major": "Cyber Security"}

**2.** What is the output of this code?

```python
grades = {"quiz1": 85, "quiz2": 92, "quiz3": 78}
print(grades["quiz2"])
```

Your answer: 92

**3.** What is the difference between `grades["quiz4"]` and `grades.get("quiz4")` when the key `"quiz4"` does not exist in the dictionary?

Your answer:Your answer: grades["quiz4" causes a KeyError because the key doesn't exist. grades.get("quiz4") returns None instead of causing an error.

**4.** Write the line of code that adds a new key `"quiz4"` with the value 88 to the `grades` dictionary above. Then write the line that changes `"quiz1"` to 90.

Your answer: grades["quiz4"] = 88
grades["quiz1"] = 90

**5.** What do the dictionary methods `.keys()`, `.values()`, and `.items()` each return?

Your answer:  .keys() returns all the keys.



.values() returns all the values.



.items() returns all the key-value pairs.

**6.** In one or two sentences each, explain the main difference between a list, a tuple, and a set. When would you choose each one?

Your answer:
List: A list is ordered and can be changed. I would use it when I need to store information that might change.



Tuple: A tuple is ordered but cannot be changed. I would use it when I want to keep information the same.



Set: A set stores unique values and does not allow duplicates. I would use it when I want to avoid repeated information.

**7.** True or false, and explain why: in Python, the expression `"quiz1" in grades` checks whether `"quiz1"` is one of the values in the dictionary.

Your answer: False. It checks whether "quiz1" is a key in the dictionary, not a value.

**8.** What is the output of this code?

```python
student = {"name": "Alex", "courses": {"current": "CIS 105", "credits": 3}}
print(student["courses"]["current"])
```

Your answer: CIS 105

**9.** Name two different ways to remove the key `"quiz3"` from the `grades` dictionary. What is one difference between them?

Your answer: del grades["quiz3"]

**10.** What does `len(grades)` return for the dictionary in Question 2, and what exactly is it counting?

Your answer: 3 & It counts the number of key-value pairs in the dictionary.

## Part 2: Code Challenge (50 points)

Open `gradebook_challenge.py` in this repository. You will build a small grade book program that stores student names as dictionary keys and each student's list of test scores as the value.

The file contains starter code with five functions to complete where you see `# TODO`:

1. `add_student(book, name)` - adds a new student with an empty score list. If the student is already in the grade book, print a message saying so and change nothing.
2. `add_grade(book, name, grade)` - adds a score to a student's list. If the student is not in the grade book yet, add the student first, then the score.
3. `student_average(book, name)` - returns the average of a student's scores. Use `.get()` so the function returns `None` instead of crashing if the student is not found.
4. `top_student(book)` - returns the name of the student with the highest average score.
5. `print_report(book)` - prints every student, their scores, and their average, one student per line, using a loop over `.items()`.

The bottom of the file has test code that is already written for you. Do not change the test code. When your functions are correct, running the file produces exactly this output:

```
Alex: [90, 85, 95] Average: 90.0
Jordan: [70, 80] Average: 75.0
Taylor: [100, 95, 90, 85] Average: 92.5
Top student: Taylor
```

### Rules

- Work only inside the five TODO functions. Do not change the test code at the bottom of the file.
- Use a dictionary as the main data structure. Solutions that store the grade book as separate variables will not receive credit.
- Your code must run with no errors from start to finish.

### How You Are Graded

- Quiz answers complete and correct: 50 points
- Each challenge function working correctly: 8 points each (40 points)
- Code runs cleanly and matches the expected output: 10 points

### Submitting

Submit the URL of your forked repository on Moodle. Make sure your repository is public, or I cannot see it to grade it.
